"""
This question is to practice using an API. The code is already provided. It uses the free API
provided by the National Weather Service: https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api

As you can see in the documentation, retrieving data from their API requires specifying
a "User-Agent": some information to identify you. That information is not verified, which is
probably why they plan to replace the User-Agent requirement with an API key soon.

For example, this is a valid User-Agent: 
Northeastern University Student (Contact: student@northeastern.edu)

Your task is to get this code to work by creating a file called "user_agent.txt", 
which contains your User-Agent info. However, you MUST NOT push the "user_agent.txt"
file to GitHub. It is sensitive personal information.

If this code works, it will print a URL. Navigate to that URL in a browser, and copy
the contents of that page into q1_contents.txt. It is weather info.

The autograder for this question checks only two things:
1. There is not a file called "user_agent.txt"
2. The contents of "q1_contents.txt" match what we expect from that URL
