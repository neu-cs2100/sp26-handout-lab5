Lab 5 Question 3: Using @classmethod to create an alternative constructor

Implement the from_string alternate constructor below according to the documentation.
The regular constructor is provided, and an additional alternate constructor called
from_timestamp is also provided as an example.

Make sure to test your from_string constructor.
