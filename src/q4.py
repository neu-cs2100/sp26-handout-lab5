Lab 5 Question 4: Class variables versus instance variables

A Counter class is provided below. It has a class variable count that keeps track of the number
of Counter instances created, and an instance variable instance_number that stores the instance
number for each Counter object. I.e., the first Counter instance will be assigned 
instance_number 0, the second will be assigned instance_number 1, and so on.

Your only task for this question is to write the tests. You do not need to add any code to this
src file.

Keep in mind that you cannot control the order in which the tests are run.
